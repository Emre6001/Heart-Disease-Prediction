# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Project Objective  To build a predictive ML model that identifies individuals at risk of developing cardiovascular disease over a 10-year horizon.  To support the model’s ability to generalize and interpret these complex patterns, we introduced a set of medically-motivated engineered features.

About Dataset

We intend to utilize the Framingham Heart Study dataset, which is readily accessible on the Kaggle webpage . This dataset is well-suited for a classification task due to its comprehensive nature and its common use in machine learning research for similar predictive challenges. It contains 15 attributes for each individual, including demographics, blood pressure, cholesterol, and lifestyle factors, with the target variable being TenYearCHD (indicating whether the subject developed coronary heart disease within 10 years).

• Total Columns: 16

• Records: 4240

• Features: Age, gender, smoking habits, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, BMI, and more.

• Target: TenYearCHD (binary classification)
